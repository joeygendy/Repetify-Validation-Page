Hi!
Repetify is an idea I have for a spaced-repetition flashcard tool that makes it easy for anyone to conver their notes into flashcards.
I wanted to challenge myself by building this page entirely from scratch, using only vanilla HTML/CSS, and while keeping it responsive.

I intend on turning this validation page format into a ready-to-use template. 
Every startup needs a page that looks good and quickly gets the point accross. I believe this page does just that.

Enjoy :)
